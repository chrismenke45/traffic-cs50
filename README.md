This is some practice with tensorflow for [CS50's Traffic](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/5/traffic/). The model predicts which traffic sign is in an image. I wrote all the load_data and get_model functions. I started with 1 convolutional layer, 1 max-pooling layer and a 128 unit hidden layer and got around 55% accurate (see [this commit](https://github.com/chrismenke45/traffic-cs50/tree/68189010654c5c2dc0b9ec970889c00304ff9728).
